MyNavigate is a Crime Track-and-Avoid web application that gathers information about local crimes and charts the optimal travel route to help users avoid areas with high and recent crime. This is our team project for CS 196.

Our web application uses the basics of programming in HTML, Javascript and CSS, coupled with use of APIs and open-source libraries. 

**Tech Stack/Framework:** Open Route Maps, Crimeometer API
**Libraries:** Leaflet

MyNavigate sisplays local areas of crime on an online map interface using API and provides optimal pathing to avoid said areas.
